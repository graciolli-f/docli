# Unsupported features

Right now Docli doesn't support the following features:

* Bash autocomplete
* Default values
* Global arguments
* Intelligent suggestions
* Positional arguments

I recommend you to check out [alternative libraries](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#command-line) if you absolutely need one of those features.
