Welcome to the official Docli documentation. This documentation will teach you how to use Docli on your next project.

## What is Docli?

Docli is a declarative, domain-specific language for describing command-line interfaces in Go programs. It cuts down the boilerplate to the very minimum, so you can move on to the reason why youâ€™re making the app in the first place.

Docli is 100% inspired on [docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.go).

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started with Docli is following the [Tutorial]({{< relref "/docs/tutorial" >}}). To make the most out of it you should have a working knowledge of:

- [Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)
- [Interfaces](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)
- [Pointers](https://gobyexample.com/pointers)
- [Structs](https://gobyexample.com/structs)

Good luck.
